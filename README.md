S.H.I.E.L.D – Smart Hiring & Employment Intelligence for Ex-Servicemen
Transitioning from military service to the corporate workforce is not a lack-of-talent problem — it is a language and system compatibility problem.

Corporate hiring platforms and ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) are not designed to understand military terminology, ranks, or operational experience. As a result, highly skilled ex-servicemen are often filtered out despite being strong candidates.

shield-ats-optimizer addresses this gap.

🎯 Problem Statement
Ex-servicemen struggle to adapt military experience into corporate-readable resumes
ATS systems fail to interpret military roles, missions, and responsibilities
Manual resume rewriting is inconsistent, time-consuming, and error-prone
This project focuses on bridging military experience with corporate hiring systems using AI-assisted resume intelligence.

Translates military terminology into corporate-equivalent language
Optimizes resumes for ATS compatibility
Evaluates resumes using keyword-based ATS scoring
Provides a clean, structured, and scalable backend architecture
The system is designed as a foundation layer, extensible to future job-matching and aggregation features.
